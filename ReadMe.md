# Machine Learning Algorithms

This is a collection of basic machine learning algorithms implemented in PyTorch. For each algorithm, there is a folder containing the code for the model, and an example jupyter notebook on how to run the code. 

### Algorithms Coded So Far:

<ul>
    <li> Linear Regression </li>
    <li> Logistic Regression </li>
    <li> KMeans Clustering </li>
</ul>
